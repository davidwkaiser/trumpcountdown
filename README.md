# README

This is a silly app I created just to get practice with Ruby and JavaScript. 

I wanted to implement a countdown in JavaScript, it turns out there is a library for that, so it was remarkably easy. 

I researched it and implemented it. 

I don't much like the CSS, but it'll do for now. 

You can see it deployed HERE:

I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp, I'm looking for my first dev job.   
I know Ruby / Rails, JavaScript / jQuery / AJAX,   
HTML / CSS, and SQL. I've used Ionic (Angular for mobile), but   
don't remember much about it. I'm teaching myself Node.JS and   
Angular 2. I recently attended Angular Summit 2017 and an Angular workshop / MeetUp,   
I'm serious about learning Angular 2.   

I'm a leader, I'm responsible, and I'm low drama.
