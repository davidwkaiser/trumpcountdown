# README

This is a silly app I created just to get practice with Ruby and JavaScript. 

I wanted to implement a countdown in JavaScript, it turns out there is a library for that

So I researched it and implemented it. 

I don't much like the CSS, but it'll do for now. 

You can see it deployed HERE:
