At first, this worked locally but not on Heroku
It appeared that the JS wasn't compiling.
I was getting an error that Bootstrap needed Tether to run Tooltips
So I added the Tether gem: 'rails-assets-tether', '>= 1.1.0'
I also put it into the application.js file
//= require tether
I added it after jquery but before bootstrap.
Lastly, I ran a pre-compile on the command line:
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile

Then i committed the results to git and github
before deploying to Heroku.
Now it works!

OK it seems to be working without pre-compile
